# Landmark-Recognition-Using-CNN
Implementing DeLF module to extract features from an image of a landmark, and RANSAC to geometrically verify if the landmark is matched.

### Abstract:

In this project we approach Deep Learning methods that can be used in recognizing landscape scenes. The primary goal is to find an accurate but still
computationally light solution capable of real-time operation in local areas. Recognizing landscape images can be thought of a special case of scene classification. Even though there exist several different approaches concerning scene classification, we try to classify images as landscape. This project will demonstrate the easy and smart solution to the landscape image recognition problem in a local region. This will be helping any user to identify any landmark in each image. By achieving this, the application can be informative, smart guide to any user.

### Problem Statement:
Landmark recognition on Google landmark dataset using various algorithms. The goal is to efficiently recognize objects in an image at an instance level, just not at the base level.

### Objective:
To make a model which recognizes landmarks from an image using different algorithms such as Visual Geometry Group (VGG) and Deep Local Feature (DeLF)

### Conclusion:
This technology can be a solution to predict landmark labels directly from images pixels, to help people better understand and organize their photo collections.

### Future Work:
- For further research, we can invariably increase the dataset by adding monuments and structures from all over the globe, as of right now there are 200 different landmarks with 2000 different images of the same.
- A full-fetched smartphone application can be prepared using the algorithm and pre-trained dataset. This application can act as a guide to tourists visiting these monuments or famous architecture.
